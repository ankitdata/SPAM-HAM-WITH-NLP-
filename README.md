# SPAM-HAM-WITH-NLP-

Here I segregate Spam and ham Text msgs.
Dependencies: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for Python.
An implementation of a Spam Filter in Python that uses Model to classify emails as spam or ham.
The program uses a small portion of NLTK to tokenize and clean out the "noise" words that may appear across the text and to get the acceptable Accuracy of Filtering
